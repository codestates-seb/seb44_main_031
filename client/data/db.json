          "content": "The issue is that the text is overlaying a div with a background image. If there wasn't an image in the outer div and a solid colour, I can imagine that I'd be able to do this fairly easily with a few small html elements with rounded corners placed in the correct places, however the background image is what adds the complexity.",
